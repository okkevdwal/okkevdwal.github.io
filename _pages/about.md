Hi! My name is Okke van der Wal. Having spent time abroad in South Korea and Spain, I currently reside in the Netherlands. I am a Data Science student at [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/). I currently work as a Data Analyst at [Blendle](https://blendle.com/home) where I work on understanding user behaviour by applying machine learning techniques.
